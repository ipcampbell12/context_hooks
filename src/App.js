//Context API
//Share state up and down a component tree
//Means you can pass data without needing to use props
//Alternative to redux, but similar when used with hooks
//Allows you to avoid needing to pass down props through lots of carrier components - components that don't use that state but just pass it down to child components

//Define shared state in other context file - providedto component tree 
//done with context provider
//can share data but don't have to if not needd

//Context used for "Global" data 
// Ask this question: is this data going to be used in multiple child components? 

//Can also used component composition if you're just tryign to avoid passing props through many levels
